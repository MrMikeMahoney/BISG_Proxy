# BISG_Proxy
Recreates the BISG Proxy (Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding) in Python. 
Using data from the US Census (American Community Survey) on Surnames and Census Tracts, it runs a probability that a given surname is one of 
6 possible races/ethnicities >> race_6 = ["white", "black", "api", "native_american", "two or more", "hispanic"]

There are 5 files used in this proxy:
  1) Names_2010Census.csv
  2) ACS_17_5YR_DP05_with_ann.csv
  3)
